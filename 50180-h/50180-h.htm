<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Barlow</span> <i>is a short, self-important person of middle age. He is very
bald, red in the face, and wears a small, neatly curled moustache;
he is dressed in the height of fashion. His manner is fussy and

the room. Seeing that it is empty, he stops and looks at</i> <span class="smcap">Peyton</span>.

<p>No, sir.</p>

<p>Not at home?... But....</p>

<p>Mrs. O’Farrell said, would you kindly sit down and make yourself
comfortable? And I was to give you the <i>Morning Post</i>.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Pompously.</i>] I can’t imagine why Mrs. O’Farrell should think I haven’t
read the <i>Morning Post</i> at six o’clock in the evening.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Peyton.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Imperturbably.</i>] And Mrs. O’Farrell said, will you have a whisky and
soda, sir?</p>

<p>But when is Mrs. O’Farrell coming in?</p>

<p>I don’t know at all, sir.<a name="page_3" id="page_3"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>But she telegraphed to me this afternoon, asking me to come and see her
at once.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Peyton.</span></p>

<p>Yes, sir; I took the telegram to the post office myself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>It seems very extraordinary that she should have gone out. The matter
was of considerable importance.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Peyton.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Politely.</i>] Yes, sir.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>Very well, I’ll sit down and wait. But I can’t stay long. I’m dining at

<p>I’m surprised that Mrs. O’Farrell should have gone out, because she
expected me.</p>

<p>I’ve just had a telegram from her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>So have I, asking me to come at once. [<i>With a ray of light.</i>] Perhaps
we shall find some explanation in the <i>Church Times</i>.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>Nonsense. What can the <i>Church Times</i> have to do with the Archduchess
Anastasia?</p>

<p>My dear Davenport, what are you talking about?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Peyton</span> <i>enters to announce</i> <span class="smcap">Professor Golightly</span> <i>and immediately

<p>Professor Golightly.<a name="page_7" id="page_7"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Hulloa, Davenport! [<i>To his wife.</i>] My dear, you’re the last person I
expected to find here. I thought there was a meeting of the Missionary
Society at the Albert Hall.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Peyton</span> <i>comes in with a tray on which are tea-things, a glass of

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Oh, thank you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Peyton.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Golightly</span>.] Mrs. O’Farrell said, will you have a glass of

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Barley-water!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Peyton.</span></p>

<p>And I was to bring you the <i>Athenæum</i>. We couldn’t get this week’s, sir,
but this is last week’s, and Mrs. O’Farrell hopes it will do as well.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a faint smile.</i>] It’s very kind of you to have taken so much
trouble.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Peyton.</span></p>

<p>Thank you, sir.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>Exit.</i></p></div>

<p>What on earth does Penelope want me to do with last week’s <i>Athenæum</i>
and a glass of barley-water?<a name="page_8" id="page_8"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>Well, presumably she wants you to drink the one and to read the other.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To his wife.</i>] My dear, I think it’s very hard that you should have
brought up our only child on the idea that my favourite form of
refreshment is barley-water.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>It looks as if Penelope expected you, too.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>I’ve just had a wire from her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>Have you? I wonder why on earth she wired to you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>It’s so extraordinary that she shouldn’t be here. It makes me feel very
nervous.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Well, frankly, I couldn’t make head or tail of it, so I jumped into a
motor cab and came round from the club at once.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Peyton</span> <i>comes in, followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Beadsworth</span>. <i>He is a middle-aged

<p>Well, I’m hanged.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>My dear Charles, I wish you wouldn’t be slangy. It’s gone out in our
set.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Beadsworth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shaking hands with</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly</span>.] I’ve just had a telegram from
Penelope asking me to come at once. [<i>Turning to</i> <span class="smcap">Peyton</span>.] Will you let
Mrs. O’Farrell know I’m here?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>She’s out.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Peyton.</span></p>

<p>Mrs. O’Farrell said, would you make yourself comfortable, sir, and we’ve
got the <i>Law Times</i> if you’d like to read it, and will you have a glass
of port, sir?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Beadsworth</span> <i>looks round at the others in bewilderment</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>By all means have a glass of port, and I’ll swop it for my barley-water.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Beadsworth.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Peyton</span>.] Thank you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Peyton.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Handing him the paper.</i>] Very good, sir.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>Exit.</i></p></div>

<p><a name="page_10" id="page_10"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Beadsworth.</span></p>

<p>What does she want me to do with the <i>Law Times</i>?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>I asked the same question when Peyton handed me last week’s <i>Athenæum</i>,
and Davenport, with the perspicacity that distinguishes him, answered:
read it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Beadsworth.</span></p>

<p>Can you tell me what Penelope wants? Her telegram suggested that she
wished to see me not as an old friend, but in my official capacity as
the family solicitor.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>I haven’t an idea. I thought her telegram most mysterious.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>I wish she’d come in. I’m beginning to be dreadfully uneasy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rather pompously.</i>] I think I can put your minds at rest. I am in a
position to explain the whole matter to you. The telegram she sent me
makes it perfectly clear. I daresay you know that the Archduchess
Anastasia is a patient of Dickie’s. And a very nice patient for him to
have. I’ve never met her, though I happen to know several members of her
family, and she’s a very cultivated, pleasant woman. I’ve always said to
Dickie that that is the sort of practice he ought to get. The middle
classes do a doctor no good.<a name="page_11" id="page_11"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>My dear Davenport, do go on with your story.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>Well, it appears that the Archduchess Anastasia has signified her desire
to know Penelope. Very charming and graceful action on her part, and
just like her. Of course she’s extremely grateful to Dickie for all he’s
done. He’s worked a miraculous cure, and I daresay she’s heard that
Penelope is my niece. It’s a maxim you can always go on: royalty knows
everything. And the long and the short of it is that she’s coming to
lunch here. Of course Penelope knows nothing about these matters, and in
a state of great excitement she’s sent for me. It’s the best thing she
could do. I can tell her everything. I’ve lived in that set all my life.
It’s nothing to be particularly proud about&mdash;mere accident of birth&mdash;I
happen to be a gentleman. A certain family. Well, there it is, you see.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>But do you mean to say that Penelope wired all that to you? It must have
cost her a perfect fortune.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>She put it a little more briefly, of course, but that was the gist of
it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Beadsworth.</span></p>

<p>I can’t imagine why she should send for me because a royalty is coming
to luncheon with her. It was very inconvenient to get away. I had a
dozen people<a name="page_12" id="page_12"></a> waiting to see me, and I was obliged to slip out by the
back door in order to avoid them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>But what are the exact words of the wire she sent you, Davenport?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>You can see it if you like. [<i>Taking it from his pocket and reading.</i>]
“Come at once. Archduchess Anastasia. Penelope.”</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>But d’you mean to say that you made up all that story out of those three
words?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>Penelope knew I had a certain amount of intelligence. She didn’t want to
waste her money, so she just put what was essential, and left me to
gather the rest.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>But my telegram says nothing about the Archduchess Anastasia.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>What did Penelope say to you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Taking out the telegram.</i>] “Come at once! Grave scandal! Central
African Mission. Penelope.”</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>But that’s absurd. You know how stupid the<a name="page_13" id="page_13"></a> Post Office is. They must
have made a mistake. I know that the Pomeranian Royal Family is very
odd, but there <i>are</i> limits, and I can’t imagine the Archduchess
Anastasia being mixed up in a scandal with a Central African missionary.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Beadsworth.</span></p>

<p>Well, my wire merely said: “Come at once; six and eightpence. Penelope.”</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>Six and eightpence! Why six and eightpence?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Beadsworth.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know. That is why I lost no time in coming.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a twinkle.</i>] My impression is that the Archduchess Anastasia,
instead of paying Dickie’s bill for miraculously curing her, has eloped
with a missionary, and Penelope, by aid of the law [<i>with a gesture
towards</i> <span class="smcap">Beadsworth</span>], wants to recover the money.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>It’s nonsense! You’re so unpractical, Charles.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To her husband.</i>] But you had a telegram too, dear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>“Come at once. Decimal 7035. Penelope.”<a name="page_14" id="page_14"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>How very odd.</p>

ungrateful old thing!<a name="page_15" id="page_15"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Exasperated.</i>] My dear, for goodness’ sake explain.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>Where have you been all this time?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I&mdash;I’ve been sitting in the consulting-room. [<i>With a roguish smile.</i>] I
watched you all come in.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rather injured.</i>] Peyton said you were out.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>Really, Penelope, I think your behaviour is outrageous.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>You see, I thought if I saw you one after the other as you came in, I
should have to make four scenes instead of one. It would have been very
exhausting and not nearly so effective.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Are you going to make a scene?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With the greatest satisfaction.</i>] I’m going to make a dreadful scene
in a minute.<a name="page_16" id="page_16"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Now, my dear, before you go any further, for goodness’ sake tell us what
you meant by your telegrams.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Well, you see, I wanted you all to come immediately, and I thought the
best thing was to trail your ruling passions under your noses.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Do you understand what she means, Charles?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>My dear mother, it’s the simplest thing in the world. You spend your
life in converting the heathen&mdash;from a distance&mdash;and I knew if I
mentioned the Central African Mission you’d fly here on the wings of the
wind.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>In point of fact I came in an omnibus. But do you mean to tell me that
there has been no scandal in connection with the Central African
Mission?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] I’m dreadfully sorry to disappoint you, mother.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>And what in heaven’s name made you wire decimal 7035 to me?<a name="page_17" id="page_17"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Oh, that’s our telephone number, and I just put decimal instead of
Gerrard.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>I thought the figures were strangely familiar.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>And there you are, you see.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Chuckling.</i>] I think it’s a capital idea. And she just flung the words
six and eightpence at you, Beadsworth, and knew she’d fetch the lawyer.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Beadsworth</span>.] You’re not cross with me, are you?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He shakes his head, smiling.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>And now, my dear, that you’ve disposed of them, tell me all about the
Archduchess Anastasia.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at him blankly.</i>] The Archduchess Anastasia? But I invented
her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>What d’you mean, you invented her? I know her<a name="page_18" id="page_18"></a> well, I’ve known her for
years. I know her whole family.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rather embarrassed, but trying not to laugh.</i>] Well, you see&mdash;I wanted
you to come, too. And....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>I don’t understand what you mean at all, Penelope. You mention one of my
most intimate friends, and then you tell me you invented her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I’m awfully sorry. I really didn’t know there was such a person, and I
thought I’d made her up out of my own head.... [<i>With a chuckle.</i>] I
think it was rather clever of me to hit upon some one you know so well.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know why you should think the mere mention of the Archduchess’s
name would make me come here.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Well, you see, I know that you go out a great deal, and you know such
crowds of people. I felt quite sure that if there were an Archduchess
Anastasia you’d know her, and [<i>with a wave of the hand</i>] well, there it
is you see.</p>

<p>You don’t really mean it, do you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Indignantly.</i>] Of course I mean it. I’m never going to speak to him

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Well, the first thing is that I simply dote upon Dickie. I’ve never
loved any one else, and I never shall.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Beadsworth.</span></p>

<p>That’s a very satisfactory confession after four years of matrimony.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Five years, three months, and two days. And every day I’ve loved Dickie
more.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Beadsworth.</span></p>

<p>I’ve never seen a more devoted couple.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>We’ve never had a quarrel. We’ve never even been cross with one another.
It’s been a honeymoon that’s never come to an end.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>And now I’ve discovered that he’s been lying to me for the last month.
He’s been coming home dreadfully late, and when I’ve asked him where
he’s been, he’s said that he had to see a patient who was very ill&mdash;such
an interesting case&mdash;and it worried him so much that he was obliged to
go to his club and have a rubber to settle his nerves. And the
interesting case and the rubber of bridge are Ada Fergusson.<a name="page_22" id="page_22"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Pompously.</i>] But who is Ada Fergusson? I’ve never heard of her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Ada Fergusson’s a great friend of mine. And I hate her. I always knew
she was a cat. For the last four weeks Dickie’s been spending every
afternoon with her from four till seven.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Raising his eyebrows.</i>] But do you always ask your husband where he’s

<p>I apologise again.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Impatiently.</i>] Oh, what does it matter how I found out! I’ve got all

<p>I am not in the least surprised.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Uncle Davenport!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>I have expected it all along. You will remember, Isabel, that I was
against the marriage from the beginning. I said, one doesn’t marry a
doctor. One sometimes meets them in society when they’ve had their
angles rubbed off a little and perhaps have been knighted, but one never
meets their wives. We suppose they do marry, but they don’t marry any
one we know. I may be old-fashioned, but I stick to my opinion that
there are only three possible professions for a gentleman, the law, the
army, and the church.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>My dear Uncle Davenport, you’re talking nonsense.<a name="page_24" id="page_24"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Huffily.</i>] You ask me for my opinion, and I give it you. I regret that
you should think it nonsense.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Beadsworth.</span></p>

<p>And what are you proposing to do now?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With great determination.</i>] I’m never going to live with Dickie again.
As soon as I’ve seen him I shall leave this house for ever.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Beadsworth.</span></p>

<p>You’re proposing to have a few words with him?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Several. I’m going to tell him that I despise him, and that I hate him;
I’m going to throw my wedding ring in his face, and then I shall sweep
out of the room.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Beadsworth.</span></p>

<p>Have you really made up your mind that you won’t forgive him?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Nothing would induce me ever to speak to him again if it weren’t that I
want to tell him exactly what I think of him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>Besides, you’ve got your family to think of. Of course you must leave
him. You see, that is what I<a name="page_25" id="page_25"></a> say, you’re not safe with people of no
birth. I look upon all this as a blessing in disguise.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Beadsworth.</span></p>

<p>Do you wish to bring an action for judicial separation?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>My dear Mr. Beadsworth, what are you talking about! I’m going to divorce
him. I’m going to make an awful scandal.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Beadsworth.</span></p>

<p>Well, I suppose we could arrange that at a pinch with the help of the
newspapers. Has he ever been cruel to you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Good heavens, no! That’s what makes me so angry. The last month he’s
been more perfectly charming and delightful than ever. Oh, I wish I
could do something really unpleasant to Ada Fergusson. Something with
boiling oil in it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>I am shocked, frankly shocked. I would never have thought that Dickie
could be so wicked.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>Family life in England is going to the dogs. That is the long and short
of it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>What has that got to do with two and two?<a name="page_28" id="page_28"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>I thought if I wrote “two and two are five” often enough I might come to
think it true.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>But if you wrote it a million times it wouldn’t be any truer.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>That is the conclusion I’m regretfully forced to.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Well?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>The whole of life is merely a matter of adding two and two together and
getting the right answer.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>My dear Charles, if you’re going to discuss life I think there’s no need
for me to stay. I’ve told you for twenty years that you’re a scholar and
a recluse. I have lived in the world, and I’m a practical man. If
Penelope wants to consult me, I am at her service; if not....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Hold your tongue, Uncle Davenport.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>Really, Penelope.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>During the last five years I’ve seen you adding two<a name="page_29" id="page_29"></a> and two together
and making them about seventy-nine.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know what you’re talking about, Charles. Dickie’s behaviour is
abominable, and there are no excuses for him. It’s a mere matter of
common morality.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>My dear, I have no objection to you talking common morality if you’ll
let me talk common sense.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>My dear Charles, they’re the same thing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>If you think you can make me forgive Dickie by telling me that you were
a wicked old thing yourself in your youth, I may as well tell you at
once that it won’t wash.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Outraged.</i>] What are you talking about, my dear?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Well, I’ve noticed that when a woman discovers that her husband has been
unfaithful, her male relations invariably try to console her by telling
her how shockingly they’ve treated their own wives.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>My dear, I was going to confess nothing of the sort. I never confess.<a name="page_30" id="page_30"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Of course, if it were the other way about, and mamma had kicked over the
traces a little....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Darling, can you see me performing an acrobatic feat of that character?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Go on, papa.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>I think you’ve treated Dickie shamefully.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Astounded.</i>] I?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>If your mother had behaved to me as you’ve behaved to Dickie, I should
certainly have taken to drink.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>But I’ve been a perfect angel. I’ve simply worshipped the ground he
walked on. I’ve loved him as no man was ever loved before.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>No man could stand it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Papa, what do you mean?<a name="page_31" id="page_31"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>My dear, you’ve loved him morning, noon, and night. You’ve loved him
when he talked, and you’ve loved him when he was silent. You’ve loved
him walking, you’ve loved him eating, you’ve loved him sleeping. He’s
never been able to escape from your love.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>But I couldn’t help it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>You need not have shown it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>And do you mean to say that justifies him in philandering with Ada
Fergusson?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>It excuses him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>What beasts men must be!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>No; but strange as it may seem to you, they’re human beings. When you
were a child you doted on strawberry ices.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I dote on them still.<a name="page_32" id="page_32"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Would you like to eat strawberry ice for breakfast, lunch, tea, and
dinner every day for a month?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Good heavens! the thought fills me with horror.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Poor Dickie has lived on strawberry ice for five years. It’s been his
only means of sustenance.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With consternation.</i>] Oh!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>You’ve never let him go out without coming into the hall to put on his
hat and kiss him good-bye; he’s never come into the house without you
running down to help him off with his coat and kiss him welcome. When he
sat down after breakfast in the morning to read his paper and smoke his
pipe, I’ve seen you sit down on the arm of his chair and put your arm
round his neck.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Outraged.</i>] Penelope!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Do you think it was very awful?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>My dear child!<a name="page_33" id="page_33"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Beadsworth</span>.] Did Mrs. Beadsworth never sit on the arm of your
chair when you were smoking your pipe?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Beadsworth.</span></p>

<p>I must confess I’m thankful my wife occupied those moments in attending
to her household duties.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>You are a lot of horrid old things. I ask you to come here to sympathise
with me, and you’re perfectly brutal to me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>My dear Penelope, there are limits.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Well, I don’t care; I’m going to divorce him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Let’s do another little simple addition, shall we? Perhaps two and two
will make four a second time.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know that I much like being a mathematician’s daughter.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Don’t you think, instead of divorcing your husband, it would be better
to win back his affection?<a name="page_34" id="page_34"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I don’t want his affection.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With tears in her voice.</i>] Papa, d’you think I ever could win back his
love? You say I’ve lost it through my own fault. Oh, I don’t know what
to do without him. I’ve been so wretched since I knew. I’ve tried to put
a cheerful face on it, but if you knew what I feel in my heart.... Oh,
the brutes, why didn’t they hide it from me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>My dear Penelope, I expected you to have more spirit. He’s a person of
no family. I should have thought you were well rid of him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Uncle Davenport, if you say a word against him, I will immediately have
an attack of hysterics.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>What you expect your father to be able to tell you I can’t imagine.<a name="page_35" id="page_35"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings, Davenport....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>I shouldn’t have thought one could describe you as either. But, in any
case, I can stay no longer.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Oh, no, don’t go yet, Uncle Davenport.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>It appears that my advice is not wanted, and I promised to look in on
dear Lady Hollington before dinner.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Do telephone to her that you can’t come. You’ll find a telephone in my

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He goes out.</i></p></div>

<p>Papa, say you’ll get Dickie back for me. I want him. I want him.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>My dear, it’s very simple. It merely requires a great deal of tact, a
great deal of courage, and a great deal of self-control.<a name="page_36" id="page_36"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Ironically.</i>] Nothing else?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>A good deal. You must never let yourself out of hand; you must keep
guard on your tongue and your eyes and your smiles&mdash;and your temper.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I think you said it was very simple.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Is Ada Fergusson pretty?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>No, she’s perfectly hideous.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Is she? That makes it more serious.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>If a man falls in love with a pretty woman, he falls out of it. But if
he falls in love with a plain one, he’ll be in love with her all his
life.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>You take a load off my mind. Ada Fergusson’s extremely attractive.<a name="page_37" id="page_37"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Then you’ll get him back.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Tell me exactly what to do, and I’ll do it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Give him his head.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Is that all?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>It means a good deal. When he comes in, don’t make a scene, but be
charming to him. For once, don’t ask him where he’s been. When he leaves
you, don’t ask him where he’s going, nor at what time he’ll be back.
Don’t let him know that you have the least suspicion that anything has
happened. On the contrary, take every opportunity of throwing him into
Ada Fergusson’s society.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Charles, you’re asking Penelope to connive at immorality.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>When every difficulty disappears, Dickie will find half the savour of
the intrigue gone. Half your battle is won. Leave the rest to time and
Ada Fergusson. Let Ada Fergusson sit on the arm of his chair when he
wants to read his paper. Let him account to Ada Fergusson for all his
movements.<a name="page_38" id="page_38"></a> Under such circumstances a woman is always on tenterhooks,
and consequently she’s always exacting. Whenever there’s a pause in the
conversation, Ada Fergusson will say, Do you care for me as much as ever
you did? That speech is the rope around love’s throat. Whenever he wants
to go away, Ada Fergusson will implore him to stay five minutes longer.
Those five minutes that a man stays against his will are the nails in
love’s coffin. Each time he leaves her Ada Fergusson will say, At what
time will you be back? That question is the earth shovelled into love’s
grave.</p>

<p>That’s how providence behaves to me. Deliberately puts temptation in my
way. It’s simply poison. Gout in my family, you know. My ancestors have
lived on colchicum for a hundred years. I feel a tingling in my toes at
the mere sight of a bottle of port. And yet I drink it.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>He fills himself a glass and sips it with great content.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>It’s a great mistake, of course, to think that gout is<a name="page_45" id="page_45"></a> a mark of good
family. The porter of my club is a martyr to it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps he’s the illegitimate son of an earl. You should ask him if he
has a strawberry mark on his left shoulder. What’s the matter, Pen?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Astonished.</i>] With me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I thought you seemed a bit under the weather.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know. You’re not quite up to your usual form, are you? You’ve
not asked me what I’ve been doing to-day. As a rule you’re so interested
in my movements.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a glance at her father.</i>] I thought you’d tell me if you wanted
to.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I say, I do think that’s a bit thick. I go slaving my very soul out to
provide you with a motor and nice frocks and things, and you don’t take
the smallest interest in what I do.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] Well, what have you been doing this afternoon?<a name="page_46" id="page_46"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a sigh of relief.</i>] Oh, I’ve had the very deuce of a day. I’ve
got a very interesting case on just now. Taking up a lot of my time. Of
course, it worries me rather, but I suppose all these things come in the
day’s march. Well, I spent the best part of an hour there.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>An hour?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Yes, we had a consultation, you know.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>But you had a consultation yesterday.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Yesterday? Yes, she’s a fussy old thing. She’s always wanting
consultations.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>That’s jolly, isn’t it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I don’t think it is. It looks as if she hadn’t really confidence in me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>On the other hand, you can charge double, can’t you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Yes, of course, it has that advantage.<a name="page_47" id="page_47"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I’ve been hankering after an ermine stole for a long time. I shall buy
it now.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>His face falling.</i>] Oh, but I haven’t been paid yet.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>They’ll be only too glad to wait. And it’s such a bargain.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To change the conversation.</i>] Well, after my consultation I was so
fagged that I had to go into the club to have a rubber of Bridge.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>By the way, what is the name of your patient?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>The name of my patient?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Oh, yes, I was telling papa that you’d got a new patient who was
bringing in pots of money. I couldn’t remember her name.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Embarrassed.</i>] Oh&mdash;er, Mrs. Mac....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Mac what?<a name="page_48" id="page_48"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Mrs. Macnothing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>How d’you mean, Mrs. Macnothing? I’ve never heard of a family called
Macnothing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>No, of course, her name isn’t Macnothing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>But you distinctly said it was Mrs. Macnothing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Now, my dear Pen, did I say anything about Macnothing?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Well, what is her name then?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I’ve been telling you for the last ten minutes. Her name’s Mrs. Mack.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>Why on earth didn’t you say so at once?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>How did you find such a profitable patient?<a name="page_49" id="page_49"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Oh, it was a great piece of luck. She heard about me from that little
friend of yours, Pen. What is her name?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>You seem to have a very bad memory for names, Dickie. You should make a
knot in your handkerchief.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>It’s a friend of Pen’s. [<i>Pretending to try and remember.</i>] Her
husband’s in the navy, stationed at Malta, isn’t he?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Ada Fergusson.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>That’s it, of course. Mrs. Fergusson.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>One of the Fergussons of Kingarth, I suppose?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know at all. Quite a nice little thing, I thought. I must
confess that she didn’t interest me very much.</p>

<p>I passed you in Piccadilly the other day, and you cut me dead.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I’m so sorry, I’m so short-sighted.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Dickie, you’re not at all short-sighted. How can you tell such fibs?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With pompous gallantry.</i>] Dickie feels that only a physical impediment

<p>Not at all, not at all.<a name="page_52" id="page_52"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I wanted to thank you for getting Dickie such a splendid patient.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Hastily, seeing her look of astonishment.</i>] I’ve just been telling my
wife about Mrs. Mack.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Not in the least understanding.</i>] Oh, yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>It was really awfully good of you to tell her to send for me. I’ve been
to see her this afternoon.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Understanding.</i>] Oh, yes. I like to do all I can for people. I hope
you’ll find her a nice patient.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>She seems to require a lot of visits.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Yes, she was only telling me the other day how much she liked Dr.
O’Farrell. I’m afraid she’s very ill, poor dear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>To tell you the truth, I’m extremely worried about her.<a name="page_53" id="page_53"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>It’s a great comfort to all her friends to know that Dr. O’Farrell is
looking after her.</p>

<p>I’ve been wondering if she’s one of the Staffordshire Macks or one of
the Somersetshire Macks.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know at all.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>How d’you mean you don’t know at all? She must be one or the other.</p>

<p>I don’t see that it matters either way.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>What is she like?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I don’t know. Like everybody else, I suppose.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Well, just wait a moment, and I’ll make you up a dose of something.</p>

<p>[<i>Hastily.</i>] Oh, no, I promise you I’m much better without medicine.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>I do envy you, having your husband always at <a name="page_62" id="page_62"></a>hand. When I think of mine

furnished room, with engravings on the walls, photographs in silver
frames, and flowers on the chimney-piece. There is a large desk on
one side, with papers on it, books, and a reading-lamp. There is a
revolving-chair for</i> <span class="smcap">Dickie</span> <i>to sit in, and a chair on the other

a stand for test tubes, one or two medicine bottles, a row of large

without arms for patients to lie upon, and there are two or three

is a pile of “Lancets.”</i></p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Dickie</span> <i>is sitting at his desk, with his stethoscope still in his

I make a living. The people who are ill either get well or die, and
that’s the end of them.<a name="page_68" id="page_68"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Patient.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I see. I never thought of that. Beautiful day it is, isn’t it?</p>

<p>Won’t you sit down?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Patient.</span></p>

so much of your time.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I always make my patients sit on the other side of my desk since one of
them suddenly saw a snake on me, and flung himself at my throat in order
to save me from being bitten. He nearly throttled me in the process, and
when I knelt on his chest, he said I was an ungrateful devil, and he
wouldn’t interfere with the snakes next time they went for me.</p>

no medicine?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Patient.</span></p>

<p>Oh, it’s too good of you, but I think, for my wife’s sake, I’d like to
take something.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Well, look here, I’ve given you some strychnine to buck you up, and some
bismuth to quiet you down. Take it three times a day after meals.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Patient.</span></p>

wanted to ask you. Shall I write you a cheque?</p>

<p>We always prefer to have it in hard cash, you know, in case it’s a bogus
cheque.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Patient.</span></p>

<p>Oh, certainly. It’s too good of you. I thought you mightn’t like it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>It’s extraordinary how nervous people are about giving a doctor money.

<p>Dickie was lamenting that times were very bad.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>What can you expect with this beastly weather! Fine, dry, cold day after
day. We haven’t had a fog this autumn. It doesn’t give one a chance. Of
course everybody keeps well. Times are getting worse and worse.
Everybody has decent drains now. An officious Government gives people
pure water. If it weren’t for patent medicines and the <i>malade
imaginaire</i> half the doctors in London would starve.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Never mind, Dickie. There may be a motor accident just outside our front
door one of these days.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>It would be just like my luck if they were all killed outright. No, what
I want is a really good epidemic, a very complicated form of influenza
that’d keep people on their backs for about a month.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>And supposing I got it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Well, if you got it that bounder on the other side of the street would
have to treat you. And he couldn’t charge you as you’re my wife, and
he’d simply grind his teeth at having to waste his time.<a name="page_74" id="page_74"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>The bounder on the other side of the street is Dr. Rogers. I like him

<p>Is Dickie still ...?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Yes. I can’t imagine what he sees in her. I sit and watch her sometimes
and wonder what she has that I haven’t got. You don’t think I’m plain,
do you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Certainly not. If you had been I should have exposed you at your birth,
like the ancient Spartans.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>There are lots of men who are willing to tell me that I’m extremely
attractive.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Why don’t you let them?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>My dear father, you’re the most immoral parent I’ve ever come across.</p>

<p>[<i>With a little deprecatory shrug.</i>] It might be politic.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Shaking her head.</i>] No, I don’t know whether I shall ever get Dickie
back again, but I don’t want to get him back by exciting his jealousy. I
don’t want<a name="page_76" id="page_76"></a> his love if I can only have it by making him think other men
are in love with me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Remember that two and two never make five.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Impatiently.</i>] It’s easy enough to give advice. You’ve only got to sit
still and watch. I’ve got to do things. And the worst of it is that
doing things means doing nothing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>My dear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Now, father, don’t look as if you didn’t understand or I shall throw
something at your head. It wouldn’t be so bad if I could be up and
doing, but I just have to sit still and keep my temper. You don’t know
what I’ve suffered this month with a smiling face. I’ve laughed while my
heart ached. I’ve chaffed Dickie when I’ve known he was just going to
meet Ada Fergusson. I’ve arranged little parties so that they might be
together. I haven’t even dared to cry by myself in case Ada Fergusson
should see that my eyes were red and tell Dickie. He’s seen her every
day, every single day for the last month, and all the time I’ve been
cheerful and pleasant and amusing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>But how does he manage to get the time?<a name="page_77" id="page_77"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Of course he’s been neglecting his practice. He’s sent his assistant to
people he ought to have seen himself. You remember Mrs. Mack, don’t you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Smiling.</i>] The imaginary Mrs. Mack? Yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>If you knew how I hated Mrs. Mack! She’s been having operations. She has
an operation about once a week, and Dickie goes off for the whole day in
his car.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>She must have the constitution of a boa-constrictor.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>And the curious thing is that she always has an operation when there’s a
race meeting. She had an operation for the Duke of York’s Stakes at
Kempton; and she had another operation for the Cesarewitch, and a third
for Sandown.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>How very singular.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>It is till you know that Ada Fergusson adores racing. And the thing that
makes me so furious is that I’m quite certain Dickie puts on her money
for<a name="page_78" id="page_78"></a> her; and when her horse wins she pockets the profits, and when it
loses she doesn’t pay her stake.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>That sounds very nasty of her. What makes you think it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I do it myself.... Poor Dickie, it’s going to cost him a lot of money
this month.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Because whenever he goes out for the day I have to console myself by
buying something. I generally choose something rather dear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>I don’t remember that I advised that in the treatment of a volatile
husband.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>No, I added it of my own accord.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>But why did you send for me to-day?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Because the end has come. And I can’t stand it any longer. This morning
Dickie said that Mrs. Mack was well enough to be moved, and he was
going<a name="page_79" id="page_79"></a> to take her over to Paris to put her in the Riviera train.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Do you mean to say that....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With an angry shrug of the shoulders.</i>] Ada Fergusson wants a little

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>What are you going to do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I’m going to tell him he must choose between us. I’m going to do
everything I can to prevent him from going. And I mean to let him know
that if he goes it’s the end.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Oh!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Don’t say oh! Say I’m quite right. Say it’s the only thing to do.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>But I think you’re quite wrong.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Wrong!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>You don’t suppose he wants to go to Paris. No man in his senses would
take the risk.<a name="page_80" id="page_80"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Then why is he going?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Because she’s making him. And once a woman in these circumstances makes
a man do what he doesn’t want to, it’s the beginning of the end.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>How d’you know?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know. I guess it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>It seems to me that a lifetime spent in the study of mathematics has

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>I promised to fetch my wife.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>You must come back. This is the first time I’ve been separated from
Dickie since our marriage, and I shall want to hide my head in the
maternal bosom while my noble father pats my hand.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gaily.</i>] It’ll be great fun, because you’ll see all the gay young men

<p>I can see they’re bills, thank you!</p>

them?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Indifferently.</i>] You can put them in the waste-paper basket if you
like, but it would be shorter to pay them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Flying into a passion.</i>] Now, look here, Pen. It’s perfectly
preposterous. You know I’m not going to stand this sort of thing.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Apparently much astonished, quite good-humouredly.</i>] Darling, you’re
not going to make a scene for a few<a name="page_85" id="page_85"></a> little things I’ve bought myself. I
was positively in rags, and I thought you liked me to dress neatly.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Hang it all, I’m a poor man, and you’ve spent more than a hundred and
fifty pounds in this one month.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Calmly.</i>] Does it come to as much as that? It’s lucky you’ve got such

<p>Senseless extravagance I call it. Now look here, here’s thirty-five

<p>How d’you mean, Duke of York’s Stakes at Kempton?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I just happen to remember they were on that day because Madame Claude
was so surprised to see me. It was only by the merest chance that she
hadn’t gone to the races herself.<a name="page_86" id="page_86"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>But what on earth put it into your head to go and buy a blue cloth
dress?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sweetly.</i>] Well, you see, darling, it was the day of the first
operation that was performed on Mrs. Mack. And you were away all day,
and I felt awfully depressed and lonely. And I knew how anxious you
were, and it made me anxious, so I just went and ordered a blue cloth to
cheer myself up a bit.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Dickie</span> <i>looks at her for a moment, then looks down at the bill, is

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Suddenly.</i>] And look here, on the 13th of October there’s an ermine

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Yes, that was the second operation on poor Mrs. Mack.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I say, I think it’s a bit thick.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Well, I had to do something while you were away. And it made me feel so
miserable to see everybody driving off with race glasses to Liverpool
Street.<a name="page_87" id="page_87"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I beg your pardon.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>You see, the 13th of October was the Cesarewitch.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>And I suppose all the others are to be explained in the same way.
[<i>Looking at a bill.</i>] October 22.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Dickie</span> <i>looks through the bill crossly, but does not speak</i>.</p></div>

<p>[<i>Innocently.</i>] I wonder why you always had your operations on the same
day as an important race meeting.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I suppose you think it odd?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>A little.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Well, it isn’t odd at all. It’s one of old Peter Marsden’s cranky ways.
I told you it was Peter Marsden who did the operations, didn’t I?
[<span class="smcap">Penelope</span> <i>nods</i>.] The fact is, he’s simply mad on racing. And he’s lost
such a pot of money that he always fixes an important operation for the
same day as a race meeting so that he absolutely won’t be able to go to
it.<a name="page_88" id="page_88"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Funny old thing.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Dickie</span> <i>looks up suspiciously</i>.</p></div>

<p>[<i>With a laugh.</i>] Peter Marsden, not you, darling.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Now look here, Pen, we’ll say no more about these bills. I’ll pay them
this time....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I knew you would.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>But there must be no more of them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I really don’t know why you should make such a fuss. After all, you’ve
been earning simply heaps and heaps of money with Mrs. Mack.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>We mustn’t count our chickens before they’re hatched. I haven’t had a
penny out of her yet.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>But now that she’s going away you can send in your bill.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I couldn’t possibly. It would kill her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Don’t you think you might risk it?<a name="page_89" id="page_89"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I think you’re awfully heartless, Pen. You forget that I’m very much
attached to the old lady. I look upon her as a friend as well as a
patient.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Perhaps she’ll leave you something in her will. We want a new electric
brougham, don’t we?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I shouldn’t accept it. I have the strongest feeling against doctors
getting legacies from their patients.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Well, you’ll be able to charge at least a hundred and fifty pounds for
taking her to Paris.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a start.</i>] Pen!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Oh, you made me jump.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>You’re not proposing to buy anything more?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Well, darling, I know that when I get up to-morrow morning and you’re
not here, I shall feel dreadfully lonely and depressed.<a name="page_90" id="page_90"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting.</i>] Have your sainted mother to stay with you.</p>

<p>And it’s struck me that I simply haven’t got a hat I can wear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sternly.</i>] Penelope.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Persuasively.</i>] It’ll make my frocks last so much longer if I have
some nice hats. You see, you ring the changes, and people think you have
a new gown on.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>And may I venture to inquire how many hats you’ll want to overcome your
depression?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Decidedly.</i>] Three.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I never heard anything so preposterous.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Now look here, Dickie, I’m willing to meet you half way; I promise you
they shan’t cost more than five pounds each. You can afford that out of
the hundred and fifty.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>The fact is, Pen, that Mrs. Mack is more a friend<a name="page_91" id="page_91"></a> than a patient, and
she’s not so well to do as I thought. I’m proposing to make no charge
for accompanying her to Paris.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quite firmly.</i>] Oh, no, Dickie, I won’t hear of it. You’ve got a wife

You have no right to be quixotic. It’s not fair to me.</p>

<p>I’ve been to every doctor in London, and they all say I’m a wonderful

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Watson.</span></p>

<p>Well, I like taking medicines. It’s something to do; and now my
daughter’s married I’m very much alone. I think I’ve taken every
medicine in the Pharmacopœia, and they’ve none of them done me any
good.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Handing her a prescription.</i>] Well, perhaps this will. You must take
it three times a day before meals.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Watson.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Looking at it.</i>] Oh! but I’ve had this before, Dr. O’Farrell. Sir
Arthur Thomas gave me this only a few months ago.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Well, try it again. Perhaps you didn’t give it a fair chance.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Watson.</span></p>

<p>I was reading in the <i>Lancet</i> the other day that a<a name="page_95" id="page_95"></a> German doctor had
discovered a new medicine which does nerve cases such a lot of good. I’m
sure it’s the very thing for me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>What on earth were you reading the <i>Lancet</i> for?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Watson.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I always read the <i>Lancet</i> and the <i>British Medical Journal</i>. You
see, my poor husband had to take them in for his practice.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a gasp.</i>] You don’t mean to say your husband was a doctor?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Watson.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I thought I told you that I was a doctor’s widow.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Dickie</span> <i>tries to master his agitation while</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Watson</span> <i>prattles

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Watson.</span></p>

<p>I can never bear to hear doctors spoken badly of. They never do me any
good, but they’ve been kindness itself. I’ve only once been rudely
treated, and that&mdash;if you’ll believe it&mdash;was by a mere nobody. I told
him all my symptoms, and he said to me, Madam, can you eat? Yes, I said.
I have breakfast in the morning and a little soup at eleven o’clock; and
then I have lunch, and I always make a good tea, and I eat a little
dinner at half-past seven, and before I go to bed I have some bread and
milk. Then<a name="page_96" id="page_96"></a> he said, Madam, can you sleep? Yes, I said, for an old woman
I sleep very well; I sleep eight or nine hours regularly. Then he said,
Madam, can you walk? Oh! yes, I said, I always make a point of walking
four miles a day. Then he said, My opinion is that you’ve got nothing
the matter with you at all. Good afternoon.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Fancy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Watson.</span></p>

<p>Well, I just looked him up and down, and I said to him, Sir, your
opinion is not shared by Sir Benjamin Broadstairs, or Sir William
Wilson, or Sir Arthur Thomas. And I didn’t even offer him a fee, but I
just swept out of the room. [<i>Archly.</i>] You won’t give me that new
medicine?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Honestly, I don’t think it’s quite what you want.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Watson.</span></p>

<p>Very well. I expect you know best. And now I mustn’t take up any more of
your time.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Sarcastically.</i>] Oh, it’s of no value, thank you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Watson.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Persuasively.</i>] Will you tell me what I owe you?<a name="page_97" id="page_97"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Oh, as a doctor’s widow, of course, I couldn’t dream of accepting a fee.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Watson.</span></p>

<p>That is kind of you. But you must allow me to give you a little present.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rather feebly, but brightening up a little.</i>] Oh, really, you know....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Watson.</span></p>

<p>I’ve seen every doctor in London of any importance, and they’ve none of
them charged me a penny, but I always make them a little present. I know
that you doctors have to go out in all weathers, and you never wrap
yourselves up. So I give them a woollen comforter.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>She takes out of her bag a large red woollen comforter.</i></p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Watson.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I’m very grateful to you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Watson.</span></p>

<p>And now, good-bye, and thank you so much.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>When you come back from the Riviera, you might do worse than consult Dr.
Rogers. He lives just at the other end of the street, you know. He’s
very good in cases like yours.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Watson.</span></p>

<p>I knew there was something I wanted to ask you particularly, and I
nearly forgot it. Sir Benjamin Broadstairs said I ought never to eat
anything but toast, and Sir William Wilson said he didn’t think toast
was at all good for me, and I only ought to eat bread. Now, I wonder
what I had better do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

bread toasted only on one side.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Lots, but that’s asking a great deal, isn’t it?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>No, you don’t care for me as much as you used to. You’re quite
different. I’ve noticed lots of things.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a rapid glance at him, but keeping her chaffing manner.</i>] Oh,
nonsense.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>You’ve changed lately. You never come down to see me off in the morning,
and you don’t ask me at what time I’m coming back. You always used to
sit on the arm of my chair after breakfast when I was smoking my pipe
and reading the paper.</p>

<p>You must have hated it, didn’t you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>No, thank you. The fact is, I’ve come to see Dr. O’Farrell

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>You’re not ill?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>I’ve not been very well lately, and I thought I’d like to see a doctor.
[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Dickie</span>.] Will you treat me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I’ll do anything I can for you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>But it must be really a professional visit. You know, I want to pay.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>No, I’ve got the strictest principles on that point. I think it’s too
bad of people to want a doctor to treat them for nothing. I really
insist on paying the usual fee.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Oh, well, we’ll discuss that later.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I’ll leave you alone, shall I?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Do you mind, dear? It makes me a little uncomfortable to discuss my
symptoms before a third party.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>You <i>are</i> nice to me to-day.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Well, when I left you yesterday we fixed up everything.<a name="page_108" id="page_108"></a> I gave you your
ticket, and I wrote down the time the train started.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Well, for one thing I wanted to see Penelope.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>It amuses me to see her simplicity. I get a lot of pleasure in looking
at her and thinking how little she suspects what is going on under her
very nose. She’s the most trusting person I ever met in my life.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>If you want to know anything, it makes me feel devilish uncomfortable.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>My poor, dear boy, what <i>are</i> you talking about?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>It wouldn’t be so bad if we had to take any precautions. But she trusts
us absolutely. Why, she’s always throwing us together. It never enters
her head that there can be the least reason for suspicion. It’s like
knocking a man down who can’t defend himself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>I suppose that means that you no longer love me?<a name="page_109" id="page_109"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Of course I love you. Good heavens, I’ve told you so till I’m blue in
the face.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Oh, no, you no longer love me. Men only begin to have scruples when they
stop caring for you.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Dickie</span> <i>gives a sigh of resignation. This is not the first scene

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>I’ve sacrificed everything for your sake. And now you insult me. And
when I think of my poor husband bravely serving his country in a foreign
land! Oh, it’s cruel, cruel!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>But I’ve only said it made me feel low down to treat Penelope badly.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>You don’t think of my feelings. You don’t think how I feel. What about
my husband?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Well, you see I don’t happen to know your husband, and I do know my
wife.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Don’t be so stupid. Of course you know your wife.<a name="page_110" id="page_110"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Very well. [<i>As</i> <span class="smcap">Dickie</span> <i>goes to the door</i>.] Oh, I quite forgot. I’ve

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>What’s the matter?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Well, I almost forgot the very thing I came to see you about. And all
through you making a scene.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Did I make a scene? I wasn’t aware of it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>I want to ask you something. You won’t be angry, will you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I shouldn’t think so.<a name="page_113" id="page_113"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Of course it’s nothing very important really, but it’s just a little

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Oh, nonsense. Of course I’ll do anything I can.</p>

<p>It hasn’t come off. I know those splendid tips.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Oh, but it’s bound to be all right, only there are some differences to

<p>Oh, nothing. Good old Scotch name, that’s all.</p>

<p>And it’s just a little awkward for me to pay that just now. You see my
income is always paid me half-yearly, and I really haven’t got a hundred

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Oh, that’s very good of you. I’ll see what I can do.</p>

It’ll be such a weight off my mind.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I met him in the park the other day. He made himself so pleasant. He
asked me if I was a Fergusson of Glengary. I didn’t know what he meant,
but I said I was, and he seemed so pleased.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>You’d better not let him know you were a Miss Jones or he’ll have a fit.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I shall tell him I’m a Jones of Llandudno. I think that sounds

Poor Mrs. Mack has asked me if I would go as far as Paris with her. A
most unfortunate thing has happened. Her maid’s mother has suddenly
died, and the poor thing naturally wants to go to the funeral. And
so....</p>

<p>Only for two days, of course. Now, I want to know, dear, tell me
honestly, do you mind?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Some women are so funny. I thought you mightn’t like the idea of my
going with Dr. O’Farrell as far as Paris, and, of course, we shall be
travelling back together.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>What nonsense! Of course, I’m only too glad. It’ll be so nice for Dickie
to have some one to travel with.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Good Lord! I might as well be a hospital. I’m not even supported by
voluntary contributions.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>The fact is, I’ve noticed lately that I’m not so thin as I was.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>It can’t have required great perspicacity to notice that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>I’m not asking you for repartee, Dickie, but advice.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>You don’t want to bother about a figure at your time of life.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>To tell you the truth, I have an inkling that I’ve made something of an

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Interrupting.</i>] Take my advice and marry her quickly before the

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>Strange as it may appear to you, she’s a married woman.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Then don’t hesitate&mdash;do a bolt.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>What do you mean, Dickie?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>My dear Uncle Davenport, I’m young enough to be your son; philandering
with a married woman is the most exaggerated form of amusement that’s
ever been invented. Take care! That’s all I say. Take care!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>She’ll bind you hand and foot, and put a halter round your neck and lead
you about by it. She’ll ask you ten times a day if you love her, and
each time you get up to go away she’ll make a scene to force you to stay
longer. Each time you put on your hat she’ll pin you down to the exact
hour of your next visit.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>But all women do that. It only shows that they like you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Yes, I suppose all women do that&mdash;except Pen. Pen never bothers. She
never asks you if you love<a name="page_124" id="page_124"></a> her. She never keeps you when you want to
get away. She never insists on knowing all your movements. And when you
leave her she never asks that fatal, fiendish question, at what time
will you be back?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>Well, my boy, if my wife were as indifferent to me as that, I should ask
myself who the other feller was.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>What the dickens do you mean by that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>My dear Dickie, it’s woman’s nature to be exacting. If she’s in love
with you she’s always a nuisance, and a very charming nuisance too, to
my mind. I like it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>You are not suggesting that Penelope....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>Now, my dear boy, I didn’t come to talk to you about Penelope, but about
my own health.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Impatiently.</i>] Oh, you’ve got chronic adiposity. That’s all that’s the
matter with you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

it?<a name="page_125" id="page_125"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Savagely, very quickly.</i>] Give up wines, spirits and liqueurs, bread,
butter, milk, cream, sugar, potatoes, carrots, cauliflowers, peas,
turnips, rice, sago, tapioca, macaroni, jam, honey, and marmalade.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>But that’s not treatment, that’s homicide!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Taking no notice.</i>] Put on a sweater and run round the park every
morning before breakfast. Let’s have a look at your liver.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>But, my dear Dickie....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Lie down on that sofa. Now don’t make a fuss about it. I’m not going to

<p>Darling, we’ve been married for five years. It’s absurd to think there
could be anything between us after all that time.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Oh, is it? I wasn’t aware of that fact.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

you were happy.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Flying into a passion.</i>] Well, I think it’s positively disgraceful,
Penelope.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I’m not talking of my behaviour, but of yours.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Quite disappointed.</i>] And I thought it was so tactful.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Tactful be blowed. You must be entirely devoid of any sense of decency.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>My dear, <i>I</i> haven’t done anything.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>That’s just it. You ought to have done something. You ought to have
kicked up a row; you ought to have made scenes; you ought to have
divorced me. But just to sit there and let it go on as if it were
nothing at all! It’s too monstrous.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I’m awfully sorry. If I’d known you wanted me to make a scene of course
I would have, but really it didn’t seem worth making a fuss about.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I’ve never heard anything so callous, anything so cold-blooded, anything
so cynical.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>You are difficult to please.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>But don’t you realise that I’ve treated you abominably.<a name="page_134" id="page_134"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Oh, no, you’ve always been the best and most discreet of husbands.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>No, I’ve been a bad husband. I’m man enough to acknowledge it. And I
mean to turn over a new leaf, Penelope; I will give Ada up. I promise
you never to see her again.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Darling, why should you cause her needless pain? After all, she’s an old
friend of mine. I think the least I can expect is that you should treat
her nicely.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>D’you mean to say you want it to go on?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>It’s an arrangement that suits us all three. It amuses you, Ada has some
one to take her about, and I get a lot of new frocks.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Frocks?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Yes, you see, I’ve been consoling my aching heart by replenishing my
wardrobe.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>So you’re willing to sacrifice our whole happiness to your frocks. Oh,
I’ve cherished a viper in my bosom. I may have acted like a perfect
beast, but,<a name="page_135" id="page_135"></a> hang it all, I do know what’s right and wrong. I have a
moral sense.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>It seems to have displaced your sense of humour.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Do you know that all these weeks I’ve been tortured with remorse? I’ve
told myself every day that I was treating you shamefully, I’ve not had a
moment’s happiness. I’ve lived on a perfect rack.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>It doesn’t seem to have had any serious effect on your health.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>And here have you been laughing up your sleeve all the time. It can’t go
on.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Upon my word, I don’t see why not?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>We’ve been mistaken in one another. I’m not the man to stand such a
position with indifference. And I’ve been mistaken in you, Penelope. I
thought you cared for me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I dote upon you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Then what do you propose to do?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I’m going to do the only possible thing. Separate.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Is that all?<a name="page_146" id="page_146"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>But it’s the most surprising, exquisite, wonderful thing in the world,
and I’m in the seventh heaven of delight.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>But has he told you so?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Oh, no, we’re not on speaking terms at present.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Ah, I suppose you express your mutual affection in dumb show.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>He went out immediately after you left last night, and didn’t come home
till past twelve. I heard him stop at my door, so I huddled myself under
the bed-clothes and pretended to be fast asleep, but I just let my hand
drop carelessly over one side of the bed. Then he gave a tiny little
knock, and as I didn’t answer he came in, and he crept up on tip-toe,
and he looked at me as if&mdash;as if he’d like to eat me up.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Penelope, you’re romancing. How on earth could you know that?<a name="page_147" id="page_147"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Putting her finger at the back of her head.</i>] I saw him through the
back of my head&mdash;there. And then he bent down and just touched my hand
with his lips. [<i>Showing her hand to</i> <span class="smcap">Golightly</span>.] Look, that’s where he
kissed it&mdash;just on the knuckle.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Gravely looking at her hand.</i>] It seems to have left no mark.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Don’t be silly. And then he crept softly out again, and I had the first
really good sleep I’ve had for a month. And this morning I had my
breakfast in bed, and when I got up he’d gone out.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>You haven’t seen him to-day at all?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>No, he didn’t come in to luncheon.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Well, Charles, I’m grateful that you never showed your passion for me by
keeping systematically out of my way.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>But, my dear, it’s so simple. Of course, he’s in a dreadful temper. I’ve
made him feel a perfect fool,<a name="page_148" id="page_148"></a> and he hates it. But, good heavens! after
five years I know how to deal with him when I’ve hurt his pride. I’ll
just give him a chance of saving his face, and then we’ll fall into one
another’s arms and be happy ever afterwards.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>She rang up last night and spoke [<i>imitating a man’s tones</i>] in a deep
voice, like this, so that I shouldn’t recognise her. She asked if Dickie
was at home, and I said he wasn’t. [<i>Imitating the man’s voice again.</i>]
Will you ask him to ring up Mrs.<a name="page_149" id="page_149"></a> Mack as soon as he comes back? Oh! I
said, I think he’s been at Mrs. Mack’s all the evening, and I rang off
quickly. And this morning I just took the receiver off, and I think by
now Ada must be in a pretty temper.</p>

<p>Yes, my dear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>You’re preparing for Dickie once more an uninterrupted diet of
strawberry ices.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Penelope</span> <i>goes up to her father and sits down opposite to him. She

<p>[<i>Joining his hands and leaning back in his chair.</i>] How are you going

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a nod and a smile.</i>] I’m never going to bore him with
demonstrations of affection. I’m never going to ask him if he loves me.
And when he goes out I’m never going to inquire at what time he’ll be
back.<a name="page_151" id="page_151"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Calmly.</i>] And what will you do when the next pretty little grass-widow
throws herself at his head?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Rather outraged at the mere thought.</i>] I hope he’ll duck and dodge
her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a deprecating shrug of the shoulders.</i>] Your mother, from her
unrivalled knowledge of heathen races, has told you that man is
naturally a polygamous animal.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>I shall never forgive myself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Do you mean to say I’m to expect Dickie to have flirtations with half a
dozen different women?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>I only see one way to avoid it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>And what is that?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Be half a dozen different women yourself.<a name="page_152" id="page_152"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>It sounds dreadfully exhausting.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Remember that man is by nature a hunter. But how the dickens can he
pursue if you’re always flinging yourself in his arms? Even the barndoor

<p>It was so easy for me to love, honour, and obey him, and so delightful.
It never struck me that I ought to keep watch over my feelings.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>We all strive for happiness, but what would happiness be if it clung to
us like a poor relation?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Pulling out deprecating hands.</i>] Papa, don’t batter me with metaphors.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a smile.</i>] Well, you made your love too cheap, my dear. You
should have let your husband beg for it, and you made it a drug in the
market. Dole out your riches. Make yourself a fortress that must be
freshly stormed each day. Let him never know that he has all your heart.
He must think always that at the bottom of your soul there is a jewel of
great price that is beyond his reach.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Do you mean to say that I must be always on my guard?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>A wise woman never lets her husband be quite, quite sure of her. The

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I suppose you mean it depends on how much I love Dickie. [<i>A pause.
Tremulously.</i>] I love him with all my heart, and if I can keep his love
everything is worth while. [<i>She rests her face on her hands, and looks
straight in front of her. Her voice is filled with tears.</i>] But, oh,
father, why can’t we go back to the beginning when we loved one another
without a thought of wisdom or prudence? That was the real love. Why
couldn’t it last?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Tenderly.</i>] Because you and Dickie are man and woman, my dear.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a flash of her old spirit.</i>] But my friends have husbands, and
they don’t philander with every pretty woman they meet.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Scylla and Charybdis. The price they pay is satiety. Would you rather
have the placid indifference of nine couples out of ten, or at the cost
of a little trouble and a little common sense keep Dickie loving you
passionately to the end of his days?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a roguish twinkle.</i>] You and mamma show no signs of being bored
to death with one another.<a name="page_155" id="page_155"></a></p>

<p>Your sainted mother has been systematically unfaithful to me for twenty

<p>Charles!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Golightly.</span></p>

<p>She has had an affair with the Additional Curates’ Society, and an
intrigue with the English Church Mission. She has flirted with Christian
Science, made eyes at Homœopathy, and her relations with
vegetarianism have left a distinct mark on her figure. How could I help
adoring a woman so depraved?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Good-humouredly.</i>] It’s monstrous of you to reproach me, Charles, when
you have conducted for years a harem of algebraical symbols.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Lifting up her hands in mock horror.</i>] And to think that I never knew

<p>We’ve clomb the hill together....</p>

tongue. Make use of them.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Golightly.</span></p>

<p>Charles, I shall be thankful when you return to your mathematics. The

<p>I suppose you’re thinking of Ada Fergusson.</p>

<p>I confess she hadn’t entirely slipped my mind.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Hang Ada Fergusson!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I think that’s rather drastic punishment. After all, she did nothing but
succumb to your fatal fascination.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>That’s right, put all the blame on me. As if it<a name="page_167" id="page_167"></a> were men who made the

you’d better be off with the old love before you get on with the new?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Yes, but you might help me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>You don’t want me by any chance to tell Ada Fergusson that you don’t
care for her any more?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>It’s a devilish awkward thing to say oneself.</p>

<p>I can imagine that the best-tempered woman would take it a little
amiss.<a name="page_168" id="page_168"></a></p>

<p>I say, can’t you suggest something to help me out?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With a shrug of the shoulders.</i>] My dear, since the days of Ariadne

<p>Oh, no, Dickie, I’m not going to allow you to sacrifice my only uncle.</p>

Llandudno, but a Jones of Notting Hill Gate.</p>

<p>Hulloa, can I speak to Mr. Barlow? Hulloa, is that you, Uncle Davenport?
No, I didn’t go to Paris after all. [<i>With a wink at</i> <span class="smcap">Penelope</span>.] Mrs.

<p>You’ll think I’m coming here a great deal, dearest.</p>

<p>You know that Dickie and I are always glad to see you.</p>

<p>She died in Dickie’s arms, thanking him for all he’d done for her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Impossible!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I don’t wonder you say that. She was quite frisky a day or two ago....
Sit down, dear. You’re quite upset. You were very fond of her, weren’t
you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Dead!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Why don’t you have a good cry? Can’t you find your handkerchief? Take
this. It’s very sad, isn’t it? And after all you’d done for her?</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson</span> <i>dabs her eyes with the handkerchief</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Oh, I know. I feel for you, dear. Dickie was<a name="page_178" id="page_178"></a> devoted to her. He said
he’d never had such a patient. [<i>Putting her handkerchief to her own
eyes.</i>] She died, with a smile on her lips, mentioning her dead
husband’s name. Dickie was so moved, he couldn’t eat any lunch, poor
boy; and we’re going to have a new landaulette.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>What news?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>She didn’t know that Mrs. Mack was&mdash;no more.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Trying to conceal her rage and mystification.</i>] I certainly didn’t!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>You ought to have let her know, Dickie. She would have liked to be&mdash;in
at the death.<a name="page_179" id="page_179"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I wanted to spare you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>It’s too kind of you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I knew that was it. Dickie has such a kind heart.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With restrained anger.</i>] I have already noticed it.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To her husband.</i>] And you were so fond of her, weren’t you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I looked upon her as a real friend.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I’ve told Ada that she expired in your arms, darling.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>With a smile on her lips.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>That’s just what I said. Murmuring the name of her husband, who’d been
dead for forty years. What did you say the name was, Dickie?<a name="page_180" id="page_180"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Walker, darling.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>Tell Ada more. She wants to hear the details.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>She asked to be remembered to you. She sent her love to your husband.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>She seems to have thought of everything. You must go to the funeral,
Dickie.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Yes; I should like to show her that sign of respect.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>To</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson</span>.] Wouldn’t you like a glass of sherry, dearest? I

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>The&mdash;news has taken me by surprise.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>To tell you the truth, I expected it last night. But I quite understand
your emotion.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>I’m so much obliged for your sympathy.<a name="page_181" id="page_181"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>I’m going to get you some sherry myself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Oh, let me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>No, stay with Ada, darling. You have such a way with you when one’s in
trouble.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Edging off.</i>] On an occasion like this a woman wants another woman
with her.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Preventing him from moving.</i>] No, you know just the right thing to
say. I shall never forget how charming you were when our last cook gave
notice.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="rt">[<i>She goes out.</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson</span> <i>springs to her feet</i>.</p></div>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Now!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Good heavens! You made me positively jump.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>What does all this mean?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p><a name="page_182" id="page_182"></a>It means that Mrs. Mack, like the rest of us, is mortal. The funeral
takes place the day after to-morrow at Kensal Green. Friends kindly
accept this the only intimation.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>How can Mrs. Mack be dead? You know just as well as I do that she never
existed.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Upon my word, I’m beginning to be not quite certain. I’ve talked about
her so much that she seems much more real than&mdash;than my bank balance,
for instance. And I could write a beautiful article for the <i>Lancet</i> on
the case.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Furiously.</i>] Oh!</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>After all, she did have a rotten time of it, poor old lady. Operation
after operation. Life wasn’t worth living. She was bound to die. And I
call it a jolly happy release.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Where were you last night?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I was at Mrs. Mack’s&mdash;no, of course, I wasn’t. I’m so used to saying
that that it slips out quite naturally. I’m awfully sorry.<a name="page_183" id="page_183"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>How can you tell me such lies?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I don’t know. I suppose it’s growing into a habit.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>I recommend you to keep them for Penelope.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I suppose you think, then, they don’t matter?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Oh, she’s your wife. That’s quite another story.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I see.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>What d’you mean by saying, I see?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>It was the only reply I could think of at the moment.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>I’m sure you meant something by it.</p>

<p>No.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Well, I think I will if you don’t mind. [<i>He pours himself out a

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Have you?</p>

say it. [<span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson</span> <i>does not answer, and after a moment’s pause he

these lies make me awfully uncomfortable. I don’t like to think I’m

<p>You amused me when I first met you, but you’ve long ceased to do that.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>It’s kind of you to say so.<a name="page_186" id="page_186"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>It was convenient to have some one to do things for me. I’m a womanly
woman and....</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>You don’t know your way about.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>For the last month you’ve bored me to extinction. I’ve done everything
in my power to show you except say it right out.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I’m afraid I’ve been very dense.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Dreadfully dense.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>But it was good of you to spare my feelings.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>[<i>With an amiable smile.</i>] D’you think it would be rude if I described
you in your own words as a conceited ass?</p>

<p>There will be no future acquaintance.</p>

<p>What have you done with the letters I wrote to you?</p>

<p>I did as we agreed. I burnt them at once.</p>

<p>I didn’t. I kept yours.</p>

<p>If you have no objection, I think I will.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Everything. From the beginning.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Terrified.</i>] How did she find out?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Heaven only knows.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>It’s a trap! I might have known she wasn’t such a fool as she seemed.
She wants to divorce you, and she’s used me. My husband will never stand
that.</p>

<p>I don’t understand.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>Don’t you? It’s very simple. It’s a matter of no importance. She’s glad
that I’ve been amused. If she only knew how much amusement I’ve got out

<p>Oh, what a humiliation! I’ve been just a convenience because she had
other fish to fry. How sordid it makes the whole thing! And I was
yearning for romance. I would never have looked at you if I hadn’t
thought she doted on you.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>I have an idea that affairs of this sort are only romantic when they
happen to other people. When they happen to yourself&mdash;well, sordid’s
just the word.</p>

me.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Advancing gallantly to</i> <span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson</span>.] This is a pleasing surprise.
I was under the impression you were in Paris.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>No, poor Mrs. Mack was suddenly taken much worse.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>It is my gain.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>It’s too nice of you to say so, but I’m leaving London at once all the
same.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>But this is very sudden. What shall we do without you?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>You must blame Dr. O’Farrell.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Dickie.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Astonished.</i>] Me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>He tells me that now I’m quite strong enough for<a name="page_196" id="page_196"></a> a foreign climate,
and, of course, nothing will induce me to remain an hour away from my
husband if I’m not obliged to.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>But I thought he was bravely fighting for his country.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Well, you see, there doesn’t happen to be any fighting for him to do
just now, and he’s taken a very nice house at Malta. And I shall start
to-morrow.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>This is more distressing than I can say. And are you going straight
through?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>No, I shall stop a day or two in Paris on my way.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow</span>.</p>

<p>How very singular! I had made all arrangements to go to Paris to-morrow
myself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

<p>Then would you mind looking after me on the journey? You see, I’m a
womanly woman, and I’m quite helpless in the train by myself.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Barlow.</span></p>

<p>I should look upon it as a privilege. And perhaps we might go to one or
two plays while you’re there.<a name="page_197" id="page_197"></a></p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Mrs. Fergusson.</span></p>

me?</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

much I love you, you wouldn’t be so heartless.</p>

<p class="persn"><span class="smcap">Penelope.</span></p>

<p>[<i>Turning to him and speaking quite calmly.</i>] But surely, if you cared
for me, you wouldn’t try to deprive me of a little enjoyment. You’d be

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
